                                    the following:
                                </b>

                                    &nbsp; The page you see is called Default.asp and this is one of several default documents which will be shown if there is no explicitly specified document in the URL.
                                    In order to stop showing this page you can delete, rename or replace it with your own default document. Here is the list of other default documents:
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; Default.aspx, Default.htm, Default.asp, Index.asp, Index.html, Index.htm, Index.php.
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; The order of default documents is important. If you have 2 or more default documents our server will show one which goes earlier in the list.
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; You also can change the list of default documents in our control panel. We also support routing for MVC and/or .Net Core.

                                </li>
                                <li class="MsoNormal">
                                    We have a text and HTML editors built in our file manager which you can use for simple HTML or configuration files corrections. However it is presumed that you already have a web site designed and have it content ready for upload.
                                </li>
                                <li class="MsoNormal">

                                    &nbsp; Upload your web site to the same folder with this default document. This will be the Default folder of your website. Default folder configured as an application and web server will be looking for the configuration file (Web.Config) in this folder.
                                    You have 2 ways of uploading:
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; 1) The FTP. Make sure that your FTP is set to passive mode (Most likely). You will find the FTP information in the Web site's properties page in our control panel.

                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; 2) Web based file manager in our control panel. You can speed up the upload with automatic unzip capability.

                                </li>

                                    &nbsp; At this time our web servers support Plain HTML files (extension *.htm, *.html), Active Server Pages (extension  *.asp); ASP.NET 1.1/2.0/3.0/3.5/4.0/4.5/4.7/4.8; ASP.Net MVC 5.0/4.0/3.0/2.0/1.0; ASP.Net Core; PHP 5. You can also store any other types of files.

                                    &nbsp;  In order to serve your pages to the browser, in the browser’s address bar you need to type the site name followed by the page name (Ex. Your site name is “MySite.com”, the page name is “MyFirstPage.html” located in the default folder. Type following in your browser: “MySite.com/MyFirstPage.html”). If you have any of the default documents it’s not necessary to add it after the site name.
                                </li>

                                    &nbsp; Initially you have less disk storage assigned to your web site than it’s advertised, but you can add the storage in the control panel at any moment.
